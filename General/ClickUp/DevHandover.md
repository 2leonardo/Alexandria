## Blocks

### Glossary for blocks

ðŸ”— Block has components

ðŸ”’ Block has no components

ðŸ§© Block has components used by other blocks

âš¡ Block has AJAX

ðŸ“® Block uses one or more post-types

Whenever a block can have its acf field type easily inferred (e.g. text, textarea), its type will be omitted.

When a field has multiple types inferred it will be left to the discretion of the dev to decide its type

CTA is always acf: link

Clones on page builder do not have to be prefixed, as they are found in loop context
